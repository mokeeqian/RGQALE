{"question": "will this work on induction stovetop ?", "answer": "short answer : no . longer answer/reason : induction cooking requires `` ferromagnetic '' ( iron-based magnetic ) cookware . stainless steel 18/10 is iron-based , because the alloy is based on steel , but the numbers `` 18/10 '' refer to 18 % chromium and 10 % nickel in the alloy . adding chromium makes it `` stainless '' and adding nickel makes it nonmagnetic . `` stainless steel 18/0 '' is magnetic ( because it contains no nickel ) and will work on an induction cooktop , but 18/10 is a much better grade of stainless steel . some cookware is `` stainless steel clad , '' meaning the stainless steel covers both sides of a different metal on the bottom . the bottom of this pot has an aluminum `` core , '' which means the stainless steel is `` clad '' over a disk of aluminum . aluminum is used on the bottom because it transfers heat much better than stainless steel , but since it is also nonmagnetic , it will not make it `` induction ready . '' some stainless steel clad cookware has a `` core '' of regular steel , which is magnetic , and those would be able to be used on an induction cooktop . for example , this one specifically states `` induction ready '' : url in general , if a magnet sticks to the bottom of a pot , it can be used on an induction cooktop ; if it does n't , it ca n't . comment on other responses : why are people who do n't know the answer to a question compelled to `` answer '' the question with `` i do n't know '' or worse , `` i have no idea what you 're talking about '' ? millions of people do n't know the answer to the question , but you do n't see them all of them chiming in with `` i do n't know , '' do you ? clue : if you do n't know the answer to a question , simply do n't respond . posting a nonsensical response does not help the questioner , and you 're only broadcasting to the world how ignorant you are !"}

{"question": "does this accurately convert to sg ( using it for beer wort ) ? i know some do not once you get in the higher sg range .", "answer": "i do n't think that anyone here can really answer this sarah . probably not . i would bet that pretty much all refractometers are off in some way shape or form as you are trying to get a measurement from a tool that is costing considerably less than what you would pay for a model found in a lab . when i was in school we used refractometers that easily cost a couple hundred dollars and i felt they were no better than this one i own now but in reality i have no way to prove it as i do n't yet own an alcolyzer . my brewing courses at uc davis involved one instructor who would dismiss us and our work if we used s.g. or brix and would only accept plato as a source of measure for brewing . `` your not a bloody wine maker he would tell us . '' that being said this refractometer is in brix and sg . to make matter even worse the numbers do n't line up in the refractometer which i am told is a common problem with these thus resulting in a discrepancy in results . we are talking pretty minimal amounts here and unless you are making beer for a commercial operation that is going to be under government label scrutiny ( at which point you would be most likely using better equipment or a lab ) , you really have little to worry about if your beer is 8.8 % or 9 % abv . this compared to the morebeer , ahs , nb , and midwest is well worth the savings . not like a bjcp judge is going to know the difference either when we are talking homebrew . i hope this helps ."}

{"question": "is the pan completely sealed , or are there drain holes on the bottom ?", "answer": "the inside of this pan is smooth on the bottom ( there also is a nonstick-coated version ) but the underside on the outer surface has little pinholes . all of the airbake products are that way - they have a thick bottom with little holes in it . that allows the air to circulate evenly and so the things you bake in them turn out really nice . the drawback to this is that water can also get into those holes and it can ruin the pan . i deal with that issue by always handwashing it and i never dunk it in water , just soap and rinse the inside and wipe off the outside . if you line it with parchment paper then it 's really easy to clean up and never needs a scrubbing anyway . because of the even temps , foods do n't tend to bake onto the pan anyhow . i 've put finished lasagnes and cakes in the fridge and freezer in this pan and never had a problem . so yes , it has holes in the bottom but they are not drain holes , they are air holes , designed to allow the hot air in the oven to circulate . you do n't want to get those filled with water if you can help it because they do n't drain . these pans are a little higher maintenance so i do n't use mine for everything but for special things that i want to turn out really nice , especially cakes and pastry , these pans are awesome ."}

{"question": "40520 vs 47520 : any thoughts if this is really the same thing ?", "answer": "forschner was owned by victorinox . long ago , forschner was a scale company that wanted a knife so they went to victorinox . eventually victorinox purchased them and used their names for years . the forschner knives were the exact same as the victorinox , except they stamped forschner on the blade . about a couple of years ago victorinox decided to do away with the forschner name and bring them all under the victorinox name . for 2011 the forschner name has been done away with completely . the 47520 is the same knife as the 40520. the only difference is the 47520 comes in a plastic retail container -- that is what the number 7 tells you in the model number . the 40520 is a bulk pack that is used for sending to commercial accounts that do n't need the retail container . while they make the switch over from the forschner name you will still find victorinox/forschner knives , but they are the same . depending on the retail store you purchase the knife from they may either have the retail box or bulk pack . since our business operates a retail and online/mail-order to commercial accounts we keep both packaging in our mad cow cutlery warehouse . as far as german steel , what needs to be understood is that companies are allowed to state a blade is made of german steel , when actually the steel meets certain composition requirements that were developed and used by many german knife companies -- it does n't always mean that it is actual steel manufactured in germany . some retailers will inaccurately advertise that victorinox or even the older forschner knives used german steel , but this was not always the case ."}

{"question": "can i boil water in this pot on the stove ?", "answer": "this is a ceramic tea pot . to boil on the stove you are looking for a tea kettle . there are some exceptions , but for the most part to make tea correctly and safely you need one of each . tea kettles are made of materials that can stand up to the extreme heat from below and cooling liquid inside/above they encounter on the stove , typically metal . tea pots are made of materials that can stand the less-intense heat gradient from boiling water to ambient temperature , and wo n't impart flavor to the tea , typically ceramics . if you steep the tea in a metal kettle , you will likely get unpleasant metallic flavors in your tea , because tea is acidic and will dissolve some of the metal into your drink . if you boil water stove-top in a tea pot , it will very likely crack , possibly violently , and spew hot water everywhere . there are a relatively few pots out there made out of materials that work both stove top and for steeping . the ones i 've seen have mostly been made out of pyrex or similar materials . do *not* assume a glass tea pot is safe to put on the stove , though . most glass is at least as likely to explode on top of the stove as a ceramic pot , and will make much more dangerous shards . personally , i 'm not comfortable with even glassware that claims to be safe on the top of the stove ."}

{"question": "how to adjust the cutter blade - it has slipped and not cuttin at all", "answer": "good question . too bad hamilton beach does not address it . i had the same problem and nearly sent the opener back . first , remember it does not cut . the front roller holds the lid down while it moves the can . the roller behind pushes up the lip of the lid , breaking the seal as it rotates . in order for the back wheel to push the lip , it must be seated under it , next to the can wall . this is not much of a problem if the can is heavy ; can weight tends to press it against the guide . if your can is small or quite light , e.g. , tuna , press down lightly on the lid during rotation , opposite the rollers , correcting the can 's angle and moving the roller under the lip . sound will tell you when the can is seated correctly and the lip is being pushed up . when the lid stops rotating and the lid continues to go around , it has separated and you 're done . once you 've got this licked , the opener works well and leaves behind no sharp edges . i really like mine ."}

{"question": "q : what is the best way to make ice ?", "answer": "a : ok , this question sounds a bit obvious , but i have found there is a `` best way '' . - attach the two pieces of each ice maker together first , before adding water - use the best quality water available ( filtered , boiled , reverse osmosis etc . ) - carefully pour water into the top hole ( use a cup ) and leave an empty space of about 1 centimeter all around the hole . the empty space needed because ice expands . - chill the ice makers in your freezer for several hours . if you want them solid all the way through , allow about 3 to 4 hours . you could also chill for less time if you want to leave a liquid center . i found that boiling the water beforehand and then adding to the ice ball mold makes clearer ice , but that may just be me . try it out . just make sure to use good quality water rather than tap water ."}

{"question": "any thoughts or preferences between the kuvings whole slow juicer and a breville juicer ? because of fat , sick and nearly dead i am debating btwn them .", "answer": "well , my whole motivation for juicing it 's because of the fat , sick and nearly dead documentary . after i took the joe cross 's challenge of the 10 days fast , i started looking for a good juicer that was going to help me through those 10 days of fast . i obviously was eager to buy the breville juicer , because one joe used in his documentary and two looked good . i was willing to pay whatever the price was for a good juicer . but then i noticed that , hey i was probably going to spend $ 500 or more in a machine , so i decided to do some research to se if probably for $ 500 bucks there was a better juicer . what i found is amazing . although the breville looks good and seems strong , many juice experts affirm that due to the high speed blade , tend to oxidize the mineral and vitamins of the fruits and veggies , for me that was a minus . besides that the breville is not good with leafy greens and due the high speed of the blade the juice yield it not as high as other juicer , without mentioning the loud nice they make . all of the cons are found on any high speed blade juicer on the marker . the only good thing is that they are fast , but with a lot of flaws on the other side . so my choice now is on slow juicers . after a deep research on youtube and on different websites i got my favorites the kuvings whole slow juicer b6000s and the omega vertical slow juicer . both around the same price but actually the omega with better stats in juice yield and pulp filtration , but at the end i decided to buy the kuvings just for one reason the wide feed chute . with a wide feed chute , no need to be cutting apples , carrots or other fruits or veggies into small pieces , that will help me save a lot of time . besides that the kuvings offers you more things to do than just jucing , you can also do smoothies or grin food ! ... .so that the reason why i choose the kuvings . kuvings has demostrated to be as good as all reviews says and can handle hours of juicing ."}

{"question": "how does this compare with the ice pop molds from sunsella . anyone compared both and prefer one over the other ?", "answer": "i have used both the norpro and sunsella brands and find the sunsella brand to be much better quality . the norpro silicone is thinner and does n't seem anywhere near as durable . it also does n't feel like a full silicone product , it has a `` plasticky '' feel to it . possibly not 100 % silicone like the sunsella brand . i also find the lids fit a lot more securely on the sunsella brand , the norpro lid is quite flimsy . i also performed the twist test on both products and the sunsella brand retained it 's color however the norpro brand did not . so i would definitely go for the sunsella brand ! it looks like sunsella have a special on at the moment and are selling theirs for $ 7.99 for 6 so work out to be cheaper than norpro per mold too . hope that helps !"}

{"question": "does this recliner have a recline lever ? thank you", "answer": "yes !"}
{"question": "is there any teflon/ptfe or other chemicals in the nonstick coating that may be released by scratching or at high temperatures ?", "answer": "the autograph coating is a very high grade teflon analog . from what i could decipher from the various `` fact '' sheets , it does contain some undisclosed level of ptfe and/or pfoa , but the difference is the manufacturing/application process ( there 's several layers , and they are n't sprayed on , but cured at high temperatures ) . however , i 've noticed that my cookware is very scratch resistant compared to old-school teflon , and i have n't had any peeling or burnt spots with daily use . that being said , i take very good care of my cookware and never , i repeat , never put them in the dishwasher . my wife did it with one of our pans ( i almost lost it on her ) and it is the only piece that is starting to show faint scratch marks . the other plus side is with the ringed pattern on the bottom , i rarely have anything get stuck to my pans . therefore , there 's no need to scrape or scrub . at most give it a nice long soak in some hot ' n soapy and wipe it down with the yellow side of the sponge . i 'm no expert on the chemicals or potential health impact , so do n't take my words for gospel , but this cookware set changed me , and i will probably never buy anything but circulon from this point forward ."}

{"question": "how deep are the screws that go in the cabinet door ?", "answer": "tiny . my organizers are installed so i ca n't check the length , but i 'd guess roughly 1/2 inch . ( this might sound silly , but you 'll find them taped to the back of the cardboard label on the organizer , so do n't think you got slighted and they 're not included -- they 're tiny and not obvious until you search for them ! ) sorry for not being exact . if a kid were to hang on the organizers the screws would eventually pull out . ( the organizer would probably bend too . ) if mine ever do come off ( i 've got little kids around ) and i need to reinstall the organizer , i 'll end up buying molly bolts or some other type of anchor so i can use the same holes . i do n't know where you plan to install your organizers -- a solid door , sheetrock , thin door , etc . i installed mine on a pantry door that has a hollow core . they 've been up for about 5-6 weeks and get constant use . so far i do n't have any loosening of the screws at all , so i 'm happy . you can drill a pilot hole for the screw , which i suggest because it makes hanging it easier . if you do n't have a drill you can make a pilot hole with a hammer and nail ( just make sure you do n't go through the other side of a cabinet door ! ) . i 'm not sure you can hang them on something super thin without mounting them to something else first , and then mounting that board to the thin one with something like construction adhesive . where the screw goes is a u-shaped place and the screw rests on the wire around it , making it snug and tight so the holder wo n't slide left or right , or up or down . it 's very stationary . hope this helps . : )"}
{"question": "how well does it broil a steak , cook pork chops , bake a macaroni & amp ; cheese casserole or a homemade lasagna , bake a potato , cook a self-rising dough pizza or make some shish kebob ? anyone tried it with these kind of dishes ? i need a toaster oven that can ...", "answer": "i 've owned the tco650 for about 6months now and feel that i can answer your question . i cook about 10 lbs of food per week and have n't used my full-sized oven since ( unless i am cooking for a party ) . the toaster oven is big , and even the back of the unit is rounded so you can fit pans that have large rims . i find that the toaster oven bakes quickly and very evenly . since it is much smaller in size , is heats quickly and stays hot . i usually bake at 25 degrees lower than packages ask for . this oven only allows you to set the temperate in 25 degree increments ( 300 , 325 , 350 , etc ) . setting a casserole on the lower level helps it bake more evenly and prevents burning on the top by keeping distance between the top of the food and the burners on the top side of the unit . i would say that this unit is up to the task , especially for the price . i bought it through amazon for $ -- fifty -- five when it was on sale but if it was stolen i would gladly pay 2-3x the price -- well worth the money . the only disadvantage ( and this is a disadvantage that i find with all electric cookers ) is the the broil is never as good as a gas broiler . it heats more evenly and does n't get that char/crisp that a gas broiler can do . but all in all definitely go for this toaster is you 're looking for one that replaces a full sized oven !"}

{"question": "do the two beds come apart so they can be used individually whe the kids get older and have seperate rooms ? also the the railings come off ?", "answer": "the two beds do come apart to be used as individual twin beds , the only catch is the top bunk foot board will have a hole where the entryway for the stairs is . you can simply cover up this area with a quilt of some sort if it is an eye sore . upon inspection you can take the rails off the sides with the allen wrench so it looks like a regular twin bed . i also went to the the bedz king website just to verify this so the answer about removing guardrails from top bunk is yes ."}

{"question": "my 07 has lost some power when vacumming carpet , it is about 6 years old , how would i know if it was the clutch ?", "answer": "the clutch turns only the brush -- it 's a safety feature to allow slippage if rug yarn or something stalls the brush . if the brush were 'direct drive ' a bound-up brush could stall the motor and possibly burn it out . so if you 're losing vacuum ( suction ) it could be leakage somewhere , and the first place i 'd look is the flexible tube that is apparent when you look at the underside of the unit . if you still suspect the brush look at the brush and the bearings for hair or yarn wrapped at the ends . it does n't take much to bind and stall the brush . you can pop the brush out easily to check the bearings . there are several good videos available on the internet that show disassembly and reassembly . if you 're brave you can carefully feel is the brush is turning with your fingertips curled under the front edge ; it should have a strong rotational pull . the brush is a 'wear item , ' like car tires [ as is the clutch ] . but if you do this , be careful and be ready to disengage the brush or unplug the sweeper . again , check out the on-line videos . hope this helps ."}

{"question": "frigidaire fad704tdp-should the fan run continuously ? since it is only two weeks old and can be returned to amazon w/o an issue , i need to know definitively ... . should the fan run continuously or not ?", "answer": "i believe i 've got this thing figured out finally . all it took was making some changes on the panel and then waiting it out and/or making many extra visits to the dehumidifier in the basement . this was about as exciting as watching paint dry but i was determined to find out what was going on . i was going to delete my earlier post in light of this new information , but i will leave it since there is some information in it which might be considered worthwhile . i had been setting my dehumidifier for 45 % , which in retrospect is really lower than you need an area in your house to be . my upstairs runs around 50 % during the humid summers in the northeast- that 's with central air running and no dehumidifier upstairs . so my frigidaire would easily get to 45 % , drop down to 40 % , at which point the compressor would turn off and the fan would continue running . with just the fan running and no compressor of course it was not removing moisture in that mode . so the humidity level would go from 40 to 45 ( fan still running ) and when it would hit 50 % the compressor would engage and the entire process would start again . my finished basement will run around 60 - 65 % in summer without running the dehumidifier at all . so as a test i set the target humidity to 60 % . i had done this very same test around a week ago but i did not wait very long after the target humidity had been reached to see if the fan would turn off . this time the compressor ran until it hit 55 then turned off . the fan then continued running at 55 and the humidity crept back up to 60. then after a period of about 10 minutes running this way with the humidity remaining at 60 the fan turned off . so there is a certain logic built into the microprocessor which probably tries to keep the unit from constantly cycling on and off by watching to see if the target humidity level remains stable for 10 minutes with the compressor turned off , and then it turns off the fan . i ran this same test with a target humidity level of 55 and then went down to 50 . 55 seems to be the `` sweet spot '' in my finished basement where the unit does not seem to need to run very often , and with the humidity level remaining at 55 the fan will turn off after 10 minutes and remain off quite a while . still , i did n't mind the unit running a little more often in order to try and keep the humidity level of the finished basement at 50 % so i took it down to that setting . i had been running it at 45 % in the period of time leading up to my first post , and if i had only run it at 50 % i would have definitely encountered the fan turning off ! so to recap , i have the unit set to 50 % . the compressor and fan run until the unit reaches 45 % and then the compressor turns off but the fan keeps running . humidity level will remain at 45 and then creep back up to 50 and all the while the compressor is off but the fan is running . if the humidity level remains at 50 for about 10 minutes the fan will then turn off . as soon as the display indicates 55 % in the room , both the compressor and fan will turn on again and the process is repeated . so for anyone who thinks the fan is running continuously , as a test they should bump up their target humidity level 10 or 15 % . that will most likely put it in an operating range where it will allow the fan to turn off after about 10 minutes at a stable humidity level . for anyone who has a fan ( and compressor of course ) that turns off and remains off for long periods of time , take the target humidity level down 5 or 10 % and you will definitely hit a spot where the fan and compressor of course need to run more often to maintain that lower level of humidity . of course there may also be situations out there where people truly have defective units . now that i believe i understand the operating parameters of my unit and have seen it repeated many times i no longer feel that it is defective . no one that i have dealt with at electrolux/frigidaire seems to know the operating parameters of this dehumidifier with any level of detail higher than what is described in the owner 's manual . they are probably all generalists however , mainly helping users with common sense solutions across a wide range of products ."}

{"question": "what is the btu of this cooler ?", "answer": "i did not do the calcs myself this info at the end is from another amazon shopper ... . as i type this , it 's 103 outside with 29 % humidity . inside , without the central air conditioner running , it 's 102 and 30 % humidity . i filled up this gizmo , turned it on , and the air coming out the front of the unit is 91 with 45 % humidity . since this cooler works by the phase-change of water into gas , you 'll need to open your windows and let the air circulate so the humidity does n't build up to the point where you 're in a sauna and start to sweat like -- um -- someone who 's in a sauna . it wo n't cool down an entire room , but if you 'll be typing away on your computer like i am , you 'll be sitting in one place . so sit next to the cooling breeze with an iced tea , and you 'll be happy as a clam . here 's some numbers for how it works , and what 's reasonable to expect from this cooler . . . everyone knows that to generate steam , you apply lots of heat to water . you 'll be happy to learn that if you dip a towel in water and hang it to dry , the liquid water changes to vapor , and in the process absorbs heat . how much heat , you ask ? water weighs about 8.3 lbs per gallon . to turn one lb of water to vapor , you need to apply about 910 btu of heat . multiply 910 times 8.3 and you get 7553 btu . so , if you can entice a swamp cooler to vaporize one gallon of water in one hour , it will ( about ) cool as much as a regular window unit rated at 7500 btu . however , this particular machine professes to vaporize about half a liter of water ( about one pint ) in an hour . one pint is 1/8 of a gallon , which is about one lb of water , so you can assume this machine will cool at the rate of 900 btu per hour , which is about 20 % of what a small window air conditioner will provide"}

{"question": "microwave for scalding : is there some reason that the milk ca n't be microwaved instead of boiling on the stove ?", "answer": "first , boiling your milk is neither good nor necessary . boiling is 100c/212f . some say scalding temperature is 82c/180f , others say 85c/185f ; i prefer the latter . the temperature should be held for five ( 5 ) minutes to kill organisms which might be present ( they do not die immediately ) . some argue that scalding is unnecessary because commercial milk is already pasteurized . however , if that were so commercial milk would never go sour . we all know it does , sometimes . microwaving is not a good idea , in my opinion . experience microwaving plain black coffee has taught me that internal micro hot spots -- boiling and above ( superheated ) -- can be created within the substance being microwaved . i have had plain black coffee boil over its container wall while the average temperature was not near boiling , i.e . the `` boiled over '' coffee could be drunk immediately afterward without fear of burning one 's self . here is the human danger of food which has been microwaved to the point that internal micro hot spots have exceeded 120c/248f : substances known as advanced glycation endproducts ( ages ) are created . current research indicates ages ( created by high temperature cooking , 120c/248f or above ) are linked to type-ii diabetes , hardening of the arteries and a list of other dreaded human conditions which appear later in life ( presumably ) as a result of consuming ages and the resulting internal accumulation of such . ( inside the body the ages eventually form cross-linked protein substances which are difficult for the body to eliminate ; thus the cross-linked proteins accumulate over one 's lifetime as does the damage they cause to our tissues . ) stove-top scalding of milk is a more gentle , indeed perhaps `` safer '' from the prospective of avoiding age creation , albeit a more time consuming method . i , personally , choose stove-top over microwave . i make a gallon of yogurt at a time . hth , joan"}

( we use a mix of veggie/fruit pulp- our standard juice is kale/greens+a small apple+half a lemon+a small chunk of ginger ... sometimes carrots or celery make their way in there . no one minds finding the occasional apple peel in their whatever burgers- it 's all part of the whatever ! )"}
{"question": "i just got the heater and put it on . a half hour later my bedroom does n't see to be much warmer and when i set it to 73 it goes right to 77 ?", "answer": "i 'll try to help . the heater has two modes . either it is on for a pre-set time or it has a thermostat which determines when it is on based on the temperature of the room . when you set the thermostat it will initially show the temperature it is set to and then go to the current temperature . in this case it sounds like the heater is not turning on because it is set to maintain a temperature of 73 and it is already 77 in the room . the thermostat is on the heater so if the room is cold but the heater is in a relatively warm location ( say in direct sunlight ) then the thermostat will be fooled and you wo n't get it to perform the way you want . i put the heater in a relatively cold spot in the room and away from the sun and other heat sources . i hope this helps ."}

{"question": "are the wire handles removable ? if the handles are removed , is it microwave safe ?", "answer": "the `` handles '' are n't really handles . that 's a rectangular metal frame that the stone sits on , with the short ends bent up around the stone ; it 's not attached to the stone at all . it 's useful only for carrying a hot stone to the table , but you 'd have to lift the hot stone onto it somehow unless you heat the whole thing in the oven , in which case the carrier will be just as hot as the stone is . i think the carrier is useless ; i 've never used it at all . the point of a pizza stone is that it preheats with the oven and its porosity lets the bottom of the pizza , bread , etc , brown without getting soggy . i do n't see what would be the purpose of a pizza stone in a microwave oven . since microwaves heat primarily by agitating water molecules , a pizza stone either ( 1 ) would n't heat at all , or ( 2 ) would heat unevenly , with only the parts of it that happen to contain some moisture getting hot , which would be a good way to crack it . amazon does sell at least one pizza stone that claims to be microwave safe ( asin b002yf46ke ) , if microwaveability is what you need most . this one makes no such claim , so i would n't even try it with this one ."}

{"question": "how does it rate as a juicer ?", "answer": "by juicer , if you mean `` does it extract juice from produce , and separate out the pulp and fiber ?

{"question": "can this towel bar be painted to match a different accent color ? if so , what kind of paint should be used ?", "answer": "yes but ... it gets hot so you should use the same type of paint that is used for a radiator ( steam or hot water ) which can tolerate the heat . this is typically an oil or epoxy paint and not a latex . premium spray paints such as rustoleum probably are the best choice if the can be used for a radiator . remove the label from the unit , clean & remove all the residual adhesive , then clean the entire surface you are going to paint , do one final cleaning with alcohol , ( after this cleaning avoiding touching with your bare skin what you will be painting ) , than spray the premium paint lightly , apply a second light coat according to paint instructions ( do not sand ) . allow to fully dry & cure before turning it on . warning it will smell for a while even when fully dried & cured . allow it to operate for 24 to 48 hours with no towels on it , then let it cool ( turn it off ) & then use as described . important note : even if unpainted , always have all the towel bars covered even if just with one hanging from the top bar and covering the others ( otherwise it will run at maximum power , wasting energy , damaging your paint & act as a room heater ) . hope this helps ."}

{"question": "how do you make espresso ?", "answer": "oh dear , the answer by adrienne douke is completely wrong . espresso is a method of brewing very concentrated coffee by using a high pressure to force a small amount of water through finely ground coffee . a french press can not make true espresso . you can improvise and use finely ground coffee and a little bit of water and steep together in the french press , but it will not be the same . espresso is not a type of roast , unless your talking about the trademarked 'roast ' that companies like starbucks sell . this creates an unfortunate misconception that 'espresso ' is a type of roast . starbucks has chosen a particular blend of beans that when pulled as espresso shots , gives the flavor of a dark caramelized roast , hence 'espresso roast ' . starbucks has deemed that this is the best flavor profile for their espresso drinks . however , this is not a universal expression of espresso . actually , many flavor profiles can be created by the espresso method and they tend to taste so much better than the starbucks 'espresso ' roast . in conclusion , a french press is a method of brewing coffee , just like drip , pour-over , and espresso . and just like how each brewing method changes the dynamics of the brewed coffee drastically , the french press takes on its own profile . it 's one of the simplest and best methods for brewing regular coffee . the key is to use coarsely ground ( using a burr or conicial grinder ) quality beans ( not folgers or the like ) , and the proper ratio of grounds to water . if its too dark , just dilute with more water after the brew process ."}

{"question": "nissan ? thermos ? is that the gist of it ?", "answer": "from coffee geek article company history most americans may think that first came thermos , then came nissan . that is true , but what most people may not know is this - the company that owned the nissan line of insulated beverages actually bought thermos in 1989. they recognized the power of the brand name , and kept it , as a merged name brand . thermos as a company began in 1904 in germany , under the operating name of thermos gmbh . in 1892 , the world 's first vacuum flask was invented by a scientist at oxford university ( james dewar ) , but it was n't until 1904 that thermos gmbh marketed the first commercial use of the thermal retaining products . they grew fast - in 1907 , they licensed the name thermos to three companies around the world : the american thermos bottle company of brooklyn , ny ; thermos limited of tottenham , england ; canadian thermos bottle co. ltd. of montreal , canada . all of these companies operated independently , but shared technologies and consulted to improve the lineup of products . the companies completely took off , with the american company leading the way . helped early on by very famous uses of the products ( like explorers to the two poles ) , thermos products were very much in demand , and the brand name became in many ways synonymous with hot beverages . by the 1920s , thermos in the us was buying other thermal product companies , and always on the forefront of newly developed technologies , a trend that would continue throughout their history . thermos was an early user of pyrex glass , and in the early 1950s , they acquired an injection molded plastics company ( `` i got one word for you , son : plastics '' was a quote from the graduate some 15+ years after thermos got into the plastics biz ) . the company was also diversifying its interests , and gobbling up companies with similar products or complimentary lines , including bbq makers , insulated chests , and more . in 1956 , to reflect this diversification , they changed the names of the american and canadian operations . the american thermos bottle company became the american thermos products company , and the canadian thermos bottle co. ltd. changed its name to canadian thermos products limited . and in 1960 , both companies were acquired by the king seeley company , and by the the late 1960s , king-seeley was acquired by household finance company . right though the 1980s , thermos was an innovative company that around the world became synonymous with camping , cold winter mornings , hot soups and coffee , hot tea , and well kept food . but they were still in the glass insulated business with regards to beverage containers . stainless steel insulated beverage containers existed , and it was the nippon sanso k.k . company of japan that was at the forefront of developing this new technology , and developing a brand name : nissan . in 1989 , household international ( the company that hfc had evolved into ) sold off many of its manufacturing operations , and thermos in the us , uk , canada , and australia were sold to nippon sanso . the thermos nissan brand name was born , and the development and range of products from the company grew steadily . in 1997 , one more major change was to come - thermos had been in diversified fields for a long time , but a restructuring of the thermos nissan companies in 97 dropped things like bbq grills , and completely focus on the product line that they started with : insulated food and beverage containers . that focus remains today ."}
